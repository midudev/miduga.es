<p>Well, here I am! Writing again in a blog. <strong>I want to try to start writing in English</strong>, as I need to improve it (although I might write something in Spanish sometime), so it will be a good experiment to try to express myself about topics that I care in that language.</p>
<p>If you find any typo, wrong expression, stupid grammar or <em>words that simply don&#39;t exist</em> you have two moral options: laugh at me or send me a tweet to call me out on my error. Of course, you can do both and I always will be grateful if you help me with that.</p>
<p>I would like to write about development. <strong>Javascript, Swagger APIs, NodeJS, React...</strong> I&#39;m learning about Unity too, so if I feel confident I might write something about it.</p>
