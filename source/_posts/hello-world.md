Well, here I am! Writing again in a blog. Some years ago I had a videogames blog called [WildGames](http://wildgames.es) and, after that, I always wanted to write again. This time, however, it will be focused mainly to development. However, I may talk about another topics (videogames, movies, tv shows...)

But, hold on, I didn't present myself. Well, my name is Miguel. At the moment I'm writing this I'm 31. Right now, I'm working at [Hubii](http://hubii.com) a norwegian startup based on a news aggregator geolocated engine. Sounds kinda cool. I've been working there for five years. Please, if you take a look to it, and have any feedback, it will be very welcome.

**I want to try to start writing more often in English**, as I need to improve it (although I might write something in Spanish sometime), so it will be a good experiment to try to express myself about topics that I care in that language.

If you find any typo, wrong expression, stupid grammar or *words that simply don't exist* you have two moral options: laugh at me or send me a tweet to call me out on my error. Of course, you can do both and I always will be grateful if you help me with that. [All the website is hosted at Github](https://github.com/miduga/miduga.es) so, if you want, you can just do a pull request in order to fix anything. =)

I would like to write about development. **Javascript, Swagger APIs, NodeJS, React...** I'm learning about Unity too, so if I feel confident I might write something about it.

You can find me on Twitter at [@midudev](https://twitter.com/midudev) or take a look to [my profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miduga?trk=hp-identity-photo).
