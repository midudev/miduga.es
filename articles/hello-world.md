# Hello world!

Well, here I am! Writing again in a blog. **I want to try to start writing in English**, as I need to improve it (although I might write something in Spanish sometime), so it will be a good experiment to try to express myself about topics that I care in that language.

If you find any typo, wrong expression, stupid grammar or *words that simply don't exist* you have two moral options: laugh at me or send me a tweet to call me out on my error. Of course, you can do both and I always will be grateful if you help me with that.

I would like to write about development. **Javascript, Swagger APIs, NodeJS, React...** I'm learning about Unity too, so if I feel confident I might write something about it.
